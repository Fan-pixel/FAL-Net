# Unsupervised Real-World Image Dehazing with Frequency Aware LearningðŸ”—

Abstract
===========================
Image dehazing remains a challenging task in real-world scenarios. Unlike synthetic datasets, real-world hazy images often exhibit non-uniform atmospheric degradation, severe haze accumulation, and significant texture loss, making it difficult for existing methods to restore realistic appearance and fine details consistently. To address these challenges, we propose a frequency aware learning based unpaired image dehazing network for real-world hazy scenes. First, we propose a content-aware state space modeling paradigm. It focus details through high-frequency enhancement and incorporates global contextual understanding at the encoding stage, enabling adaptive representation of complex textures. Second, to effectively handle spatially non-uniform degradation, a hazy density estimation module is designed to guide multiple expert-gated feedback units, which dynamically select feature fusion paths. Finally, we propose a contour-guided differentiable frequency domain enhancement mechanism to explicitly recover edge and texture details in degraded regions. Extensive experiments on real-world hazy datasets under unsupervised settings demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, validating its effectiveness and strong practical potential under complex atmospheric conditions.
